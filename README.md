# Community Library

## Usage

To use this app, clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Create a user account and add as many books as you'd like. You can track your own book collection with this app, and/or use in conjunction with friends. The app allows you to mark some books as 'available' which means other users can request to borrow them.
